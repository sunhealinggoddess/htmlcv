  <p> Akhyra (they/them) is Filipinx/Kashmiri/Jamaican Non-Binary queer who is passionate about decolonization and liberation for black people, indigenous people, people of colour (BIPOC) and allies.
    Before Akhyra started practicing & teaching yoga they became a Certified Crystal Reiki Practitioner, travelling around to different countries offering healings in festivals. By 2017, Akhyraâ€™s passion increased and pushed them to be more involved
    in traditional methods of healing and to be able to share them with others.
    Akhyra aspires to provide and nourishes mind-body-soul alignment practices, create grounded safe spaces with anti-oppression and liberation for all beings.
